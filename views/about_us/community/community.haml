        We believe in working safely, not only in the plant, but at the customer site. 
        Safety contributes to a healthy workforce and a financially healthy company. 
        We have dedicated thousands of dollars and hundreds of manhours to safety training and awareness. 
        We committed resources and established a Safety Program that manages our safety process and 
        conducts training. This builds a strong foundation and gives us the human and 
        financial resources to continue growing.

        Safety training is a vital part of our team member orientation. Each new team member 
        receives information and training about safety guidelines as well as specific 
        departmental or job training from his or her immediate supervisor. 
        All route service representatives undergo a comprehensive safety 
        orientation from our Route management before ever working for Jackson. 
        All Jackson Services safety committee members meet quarterly to review all safety concerns.
